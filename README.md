Form Management:

Allow users to create, update, and delete forms.
Each form can have a unique name and a list of associated questions.

Question Management:

Enable users to create, update, and delete questions.
Each question should have a question text, a question type (e.g., text, multiple-choice), and optional metadata.

Response Collection:

Provide the ability to store responses submitted by users for each form.
Each response should be associated with a specific form and contain a timestamp indicating when it was received.

Answer Storage:

Store the actual answers given by users for each question in the responses.
Each answer should be linked to its corresponding question and response.

Multilingual Support:

Facilitate multilingual forms to cater to users from different countries.
The system should handle forms, questions, and answers in multiple languages.

Post-Submission Business Logic:

Implement a flexible plugin system to support various post-submission actions based on different use cases.
Each new use case can be handled by creating a new "Action Plugin" that processes responses and takes appropriate actions based on specific rules or requirements.

Google Sheets Integration (Chosen Use Case):

Design and implement a service that exports response data to Google Sheets.
Map each response to a row and questions to columns in the Google Sheets.
Allow users to connect their CRM systems and generate graphs and charts using Google Sheets features.

Scalability and Fault Tolerance:

Design the data store to be scalable to handle large volumes of responses across multiple forms and organizations.
Implement sharding and indexes in MongoDB to optimize performance and data distribution.
Plan for fault tolerance and implement mechanisms to recover from failures, such as power/internet outages.

Eventual Consistency:

Ensure that the system handles eventual consistency, allowing time for actions to propagate across the platform.
Mitigate any potential data consistency issues and provide mechanisms for retries in case of failures.

Security and Access Control:

Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure data security and control access to sensitive data and actions.
Protect the data store and sensitive information from unauthorized access.

Logging and Monitoring:

Implement logging to track various events, actions, and errors occurring in the system.
Monitor system health, response processing times, and resource utilization to ensure efficient performance.

Extensibility and Plug-n-Play Architecture:

Design the solution to be easily extensible for future use cases without requiring a backend overhaul.
Allow new "Action Plugins" to be added to handle different post-submission business logic.
